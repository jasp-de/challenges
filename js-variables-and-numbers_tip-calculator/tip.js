// Steps
// Create a new JavaScript file in VS Code.
// Initialize a assign values to 2 variables:
// A variable which will hold the value of the meal cost.
// A variable which will hold the value of the tip percentage.
// Calculate the tip amount by multiplying the meal cost by the tip percentage, and store the result in a variable called tipAmount.
// Calculate the total cost of the meal, including tip, by adding the mealCost variable and the tipAmount variable, and store the result in a variable called totalCost.
// Log out a message using the console.log() method that should look like this: // The total cost of your bill is: 33 euros

let meal = 100;
let tipPercentage = 0.1;
let tipAmount = meal * tipPercentage;
let mealCost = meal + tipAmount;
console.log(meal);
console.log(tipPercentage);
console.log(tipAmount);
console.log("The total cost of your bill is", mealCost);
